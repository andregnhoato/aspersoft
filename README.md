This project was developed to manage experiments aimed at agricultural irrigation, used by agricultural engineers who need to manage and collect statistics on the distribution of water in a rain gauge network. It is part of the PhD project of Dr Paulo Lopes de Menezes with the title Model Development Neural Networks for Precipitation Simulation in Aspersion irrigation. The simulation of an actual experiment is generated by means of a neural network formed with the lower error line to do so.

desktop application developed with JavaFX, JPA and Hibernate.
uses HSQLDB (HyperSQLDB), relational database writing in Java.

needs JDK - 1.7 or higher
